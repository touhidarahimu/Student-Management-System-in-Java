# Student Management System

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a comprehensive Java application designed to assist educational institutions in managing student data efficiently. Built using **NetBeans IDE**, this application encompasses features for student registration, course management, academic performance tracking, and report card generation. By automating these processes, the system helps reduce administrative workload and improves the overall educational experience for both students and faculty.

## Features
The application offers a range of functionalities, including:

- **Student Registration**: Users can register new students into the system by providing essential information such as name, date of birth, contact details, and course enrollment. This feature ensures that all students are accurately recorded in the system.

- **Profile Management**: The system allows administrators to view and edit student profiles, ensuring that all information is up-to-date and accurate. This facilitates easy tracking of student progress and personal details.

- **Course Creation/Enrollment**: Faculty members can create courses and manage student enrollments efficiently, allowing students to easily sign up for classes. This feature helps streamline the course registration process.

- **Marks Entry/Overview**: Educators can enter and review student marks for different subjects, making it easier to track academic performance throughout the semester. This feature provides a centralized location for managing grades.

- **Grade Calculation**: The application automatically calculates final grades based on entered marks, minimizing manual calculations and errors. This ensures accuracy in reporting student performance.

- **Report Card Generation**: Users can generate and download report cards for students, providing a comprehensive overview of their academic performance. This feature enhances communication between the institution and students/parents.

## Technologies Used
This project employs several technologies to create a robust and scalable application:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used to develop the application, chosen for its platform independence and object-oriented features, which facilitate code reuse and scalability.

- **NetBeans IDE**: The integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitates project management, coding, and debugging. Its user-friendly interface makes it easy for developers to work on Java applications.

- **MySQL**: A widely-used relational database management system (RDBMS) utilized to store and manage student and course data. MySQL's robust features provide secure data storage and retrieval.

- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: A Java-based API that enables connectivity between the Java application and the MySQL database, allowing for data retrieval and manipulation. This is crucial for executing SQL queries and managing database operations.
